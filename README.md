People while shopping often get confused between certain products which one to buy or what other products go by their taste which they are currently viewing. We are trying to build a graph based system which will help the people purchasing the products which suits their requirement. Requirement in the sense that which cloth and accessories go well among a range of cloth and accessories. So, we are trying to build a recommender system which will help to identify the perfect choice for them and will ease their search.
The system we develop is capable of recommending which clothes and accessories will go well together (and which will not), amongst a host of other applications.

#### Dependencies ####
* python 3.x
* flask >= 0.10.x
* scikit-learn

Run ```model.py``` for making the code run.
For a demo of how the system runs please watch the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ep-sg-7lMfw
